## What is GraphQL

>"GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data"

Notes:
- Define a schema to model your data, and resolvers used to fetch your data
- Single endpoint to post queries and mutations to
- Client can specify what data to return
- Generated documentation
- Awesome toolings

---

`git clone https://github.com/pooleparty/presentations.git`

## Goals

- Create GraphQL server with graphql-yoga
- Use Apollo React components to fetch and mutate data

Notes:
- graphql-yoga is by Prisma
- Super easy way to spin up a graphql server
- It's a combination of Express.js and other graphql libraries
- Apollo is a GraphQL Saas company
- they provide several open source GraphQL libraries
