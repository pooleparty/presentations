    <h1>pliable</h1>
    <notes>
      Biggest enemy of this tenant is speculative generality.
      We build things that we assume will stand the test of time instead of creating the things that we need for right
      now and see how it evolves.

    <h1>DRY code is dead code</h1>
    <notes>
      Playdoh example.
      Pliable doh is easy to work with and change.
      Dried doh is difficult to shape and cracks/breaks when pushed to change. Needs to be rehydrated in order to
      change shape.

      As developers, we like to have hard and fast rules for the ways we develop, but there are no universal rules.
      There are no rules that can be applied to every situation.

      There is a context for the rules and patterns we like to follow.

    <notes>
      There are things that we know that need to be stable or become stable over time.
      The things that we don't know are things that need to stay pliable.

      We get into trouble when we try to apply rules across this distinction.

      DRY code is good for stable code, but when applied to things we don&#39;t know that need to change often, DRY
      principles can prove to be more harmful that helpful.
      Readability is high value for code that changes all the time, but is not as important for stable code.
      Performance may trump readabiltiy for stable code.

    <notes>
      This is like optimizing your golf game around getting holes in one.
      I don't need to become a better golfer (developer) if I can just get more holes in one (building things right
      the first time).
      SG creates this idea that we can get something correct the first time and not have to worry about it in the
      future.

      Every props in this component adds some level of configuration and makes the component very opinionated and hard

    <notes>
      Look at your code in terms of churn versus complexity.

      Don't be eager to refactor code that is stable and has not been touched in a while.

      If churn is low and complexity is high or churn is high but complexity is low, don't touch it.

      Look for outliers with high churn and high complexity.

      Don't get caught up in the implementation of a component.

      Think more about the interface of said component and how difficult or easy it will be to swap out in the future.
