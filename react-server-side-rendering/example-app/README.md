# React Server-Side Rendering Example

This is a small example application demonstrating how to accomplish server side rendering with React and how it differs from traditional client side rendering.

### Install Dependencies
```
nvm use

npm install
```

### Run Development Mode
```
npm run dev
```

### Run Production Build
```
npm run build
```

Hit `http://localhost:3001/` in your browser to see server side rendering in action.

Likewise, hit `http://localhost:3001/client` to see client side rendering.

To really see the effects of server side rendering, throttle your network speed using your browser's development tools.
