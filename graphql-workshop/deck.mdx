<h2>What is GraphQL?</h2>

<Notes>
  GraphQL is:
  <ul>
    <li>
      a specification for a query language for APIs and server side runtime to
      execute them
    </li>
    <li>language agnostic</li>
    <li>database agnostic</li>
    <li>transport layer agnostic</li>
  </ul>
  The original Facebook implementation is in Node

## A Comparison

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
  <thead>
    <th>REST</th>
    <th>GraphQL</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Appear>
      <tr>
        <td>dumb endpoints return predefined static structures of data</td>
        <td>
          single smart endpoint that handles the fetching of data to build a
          highly customized response
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>under/over fetching of data</td>
        <td>declarative data fetching</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>documentation = extra work</td>
        <td>documentation = automatic</td>
      </tr>
    </Appear>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Notes>
  <h2>Endpoints</h2>
  <p>
    In REST, you have a bunch of dumb endpoints which return predefined static
    structures of data. However, in GraphQL, you have ONE (!) smart endpoint
    where you send all your queries and let GraphQL handle the fetching of data
    to build a highly customized response, just for you.
  </p>
  <h2>Data Fetching</h2>
  <p>
    In REST, we often end up compromising by using an existing API and only
    picking out certain fields to use. This doesn’t sound too bad until you
    calculate the amount of unused data that is sent over the network. This can
    reduce performance over time, especially in mobile apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    No more under fetching or over fetching of data! We all know the pain of
    updating the view and then realizing that we need more/less data from the
    back-end. Off we go tapping the shoulder of a back-end developer to modify
    an existing API or create a new one.
  </p>
  <p>
    GraphQL enables rapid product iterations since front end and back end
    developers can work independently. Moreover, consider the quality of
    analytics. With REST, we know which APIs are most used, but we have no idea
    which fields are. In GraphQL, we have analytics for every field.
  </p>
  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    With REST, adding documentation to an API is normall a manual process of
    annotating endpoints. With GraphQL, since you have to define your schema,
    graphql uses that to create automation documentation for you API
  </p>

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={`
GET /api/book/:id
GET /api/author/:id
GET /api/author/:id/books
`}
/>

<Notes>
  Typically, if you wanted to fetch data from an API that holds book
  information, you would have a specific endpoint or URL that you are hitting,
  in this case it would be, exampleURL.com/book/:id. What would be returned is a
  title, a genre, and maybe some reviews. Now, if you wanted to pull in some
  data about an author you would have to make another request to another
  endpoint, exampleURL.com/author/:id, this would return an author name, age,
  biography, and BookIds. Lastly, if you wanted to receive information about
  books specific to an author other you would have to make another request. As
  you can see, we’ve already made three requests to receive basic information.

## Building blocks of GraphQL

1. Queries
2. Schema
3. Resolvers

---

export default Layout;

## Queries

Clients send these to specify the data they need (query) or action to perform (mutation or subscription)

<Notes>
  "Queries" is an umbrella term for query (fetch data), mutation (modify data)
  and subscription (subscribe to events such as creation of a particular
  record).
</Notes>

---

export default LayoutNoFooter;

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  title="Example Query"
  language="graphql"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/query.graphql')}
/>

---

export default LayoutNoFooter;

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  title="Example Query Response"
  language="json"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/response.js')}
/>

---

export default LayoutNoFooter;

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  title="Example Mutation"
  language="graphql"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/mutation.graphql')}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    In REST, any request might end up causing some side-effects on the server,
    but by convention it's suggested that one doesn't use GET requests to modify
    data.
  </p>
  <p>
    GraphQL is similar - technically any query could be implemented to cause a
    data write. However, it's useful to establish a convention that any
    operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like in queries, if the mutation field returns an object type, you can
    ask for nested fields. This can be useful for fetching the new state of an
    object after an update.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the id, name, and genre of the newly created book will be
    returned
  </p>

## Schema

contract for client-server communication

<Notes>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Specifies what queries clients are allowed to make, the types of data that
      can be fetched and relationships between types.
    </li>
    <li>Defined using GraphQL’s Schema Definition Language (SDL).</li>
  </ul>
</Notes>

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  language="graphql"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/schema.graphql')}
/>

export default Layout;

## Resolvers

Every field has a resolver function, which specifies how that field is connected to the back end and fetches data for that field from a database(s)/ microservice/ existing API.

---

export default LayoutNoFooter;

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  language="javascript"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/resolver.js')}
/>

<Notes>
  This example is written in JavaScript, however GraphQL servers can be built in
  many different languages.
  <strong>A resolver function receives four arguments:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      obj The previous object, which for a field on the root Query type is often
      not used.
    </li>
    <li>args The arguments provided to the field in the GraphQL query.</li>
    <li>
      context A value which is provided to every resolver and holds important
      contextual information like the currently logged in user, or access to a
      database.
    </li>
    <li>
      info A value which holds field-specific information relevant to the
      current query as well as the schema details, also refer to type
      GraphQLResolveInfo for more details.
    </li>
  </ul>

## Protecting your API

<Notes>
  <p>
    You may be saying to yourself, "hang on a second, what prevents a user from
    querying for passwords, or other sensitive data?". Simple, just don't expose
    that data in your schema and users will not be able to query for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The schema and resolvers make sure that you are only letting clients query
    data that YOU are comfortable sharing. Using GraphQL doesn’t mean clients
    can ask for anything and receive it, which is a common misconception.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can protect your server by using techniques such as timeouts, specifying
    a maximum query depth and throttling based on server time and query
    complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    GraphQL is a lot like life. You have the freedom to ask for anything, but
    you don’t always get it.
  </p>
