# Working as a One Engineer Team

---
export default Layout;

## Background

What lead to the creation of a one engineer team?

<Notes>
- Other team members had the opportunity to move to another squad
- Had a clear scope of work remaining for the Ocho
- started F19-Q4-S7 (6/26 - 7/10)
</Notes>

## What Happened

<Notes>
  Ticketed work completion stayed about the same on average as fully staffed
  team.

## What Else Happened

<Notes>
  Other activities and responsibilities suffered due to amount of focus on
  getting team work done for impending deadline

<Notes>
  Started the one engineer team strong, getting code reviews from others, having
  technical discussions about stories.
</Notes>

<div style={{ margin: 'auto' }}>...and went a bit downhill over time</div>

</Image>

<Notes>
  Stopped getting as many code reviews - Team grooming was significantly cut
  down (did not size or dicuss tickets with other engineers) - Stopped coming
  into the office as much (lack of social interaction)
</Notes>

## A single engineer can be a bottleneck

<Notes>
  - A single person can only get so much done in a set amount of time. - Any
  distraction causes an full stop on engineering productivity. - If something
  breaks, all the focus of the team has to turn to the broken thing and nothing
  else gets done.
</Notes>

## Little to no knowledge transfer

<Notes>
  With no one else looking at code reviews and no technical discussions with
  others, all the work I did during this time is a black box that will require
  time for other engis to come up to speed on
</Notes>

## Lack of technical collaboration

<Appear>and social interaction</Appear>

<Notes>
  Work done during this time as a single engineer team tends to lean toward the
  fast and cheap end of the spectrum.
</Notes>

## Conclusion

Would not recommend for any extended period of time

---
export default Layout;

## What I'm NOT saying

<ul>
<li>The team was not efficient and effective before being reduced</li>
<li>Non-engineer team members did not contribute to team velocity</li>
<li>This is how to get more stuff done faster</li>
</ul>

---
export default Layout;

## Suggestions for if you really really want to do it

<ul>
<li>Manage expectations, both from the engineering and product side</li>
<li>Have a plan to disolve or restaff the reduced team</li>
<li>Try to pull in other engineers to bounce ideas off of and get technical feedback</li>
</ul>
