    <h1>Please don't mock me</h1>
    <notes>
      This talk is about some of the do's and don'ts of mocking in tests.

      It was originally given by Justin Searls at JSConf US 2018.

      There are four sections to this talk:
      - obvious abuses of mocking
      - less obvious abuses of mocking
      - rational but dubios uses of mocking
      - the only real good use of mocking

      real - if all dependencies are real and you're calling a subject in a test then we are invoking it
      like we always do
      fake - still pretty straightforward because mocking libraries are pretty sophisticated and we have full control
      of dependencies
      both - hard to tell what is being tested and thus the value of the test.

    😭 faking parts of the thing being tested
    <notes>
      People mock parts of the subject being tested and argue that "oh this module is so huge that I have to fake out
      parts of it to test other parts".

      Mocking parts of a huge module that you are testing means that there are two problems:
      You have a module that no one understands and tests that no one trusts

      The solution here is to fix the giant module and split it into smaller separate modules that can be more easily
      tested.

    😭 replacing some, but not all, dependencies
    <notes>
      There is no threshold or limit on the number of things we can mock.
      There is no imaginary "mockometer" that will set off alarms if you mock too much.
    </notes>

  <div>
    design tests to fail
    <notes>
      If a test never fails, it has not given you any valuable feedback. Design how things should fail.

      Wired unit test: If nothing is mocked, tests should fail when dependencies' behavior changes.
      Therefore, we should limit redundant coverage to reduce the cost of change. If 20 things require a module and
      that module changes, we have to update 20 tests.

      Isolated unit test: If everything is mocked, tests should fail when dependencies' API changes.
      Therefore, we should create integration tests that ensure that everything is plugged in correctly.

      Half and half unit test: If some dependencies are mocked and some are not, tests could fail if anything changes.
      Therefore, we should not write tests like this.

      Don't critique how much people are mocking, critique HOW they are mocking.

    people value realness over experimental control
    <notes>
      The common thread between these three examples is the idea that people value realness over experimental control.

      Instead of treating realness as a virtue to be maximized, we should clarify what our test is trying to prove and
      then use all of our tools -- mocks included -- to ensure we have sufficient experimental control.

    😢 mocking 3rd-party dependencies

        <td>thing we own</td>

          change it
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3rd-party thing</td>
        <td>useless pain</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <notes>
      If you own the things that is hard to mock, change it. The test is providing valuable feedback that the module is
      difficult to use.

      If a 3rd party module is difficult to mock, there is not much you can do to remedy the situation. Trying mock
      these difficult 3rd-party modules cause useless pain.

      Wrap 3rd party modules in custom modules that we do own.

      Don't have to unit test these custom wrapper modules, we can trust the 3rd-party modules to
      work.

    😢 tangling logic and delegation
    <notes>
      Tangling logic and delegation to dependencies.
    </notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    we assume that tests make change safe
    <notes>
      We naively assume that tests make change safe, but we need to think more about what kind of tests make what kind
      of change what kind of safe.

      If you are writing a test that has no dependencies, then the test specifies logic. Thus, if the logic changes,
      the test needs to change.

      If a test contains mocked out dependencies, the test specifies relationships. Thus, when the contracts change,
      the test needs to change.

      But what is a test contains both logic and mocked dependencies? The recommendation is to spin off the logic
      portion of the module you are testing into its own module and have the test subject's only concern be delegation.

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>test specifies</th>
        <th>makes us feel</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>logic</td>
        <td class="center">👌</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>relationships</td>
        <td class="center">👍</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>both</td>
        <td class="center">😨</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <notes>
      If a test specifies logic, it makes us feel great because it is easy to test by just passing in values.

      If a test specifies relationships, it makes us feel good that there is some sort of evidence the design of the
      system is being validated.

      If a test specifies both, it will be hard to maintain and makes us feel unsafe.

    😢 mocking intermediate data providers

    <notes>
      In a system with many layers of dependencies, it's sometimes difficult to determine which layer to test.

      The answer is: it depends.

      If you are writing isolated unit tests, you should mock out the direct dependencies of the test subject and only
      use the minimal amount test data to test the behavior of the subject.

      If you are shooting for regression safety, you want to keep everything realistic or stay as far to the edges of
      the system as possible.

      Don't mock at arbitrary depth. This will cause tests to fail for reasons not associated to the subject and test
      data is not related to the subject.
    </notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>mocked layer</th>
        <th>meaningful failure?</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>direct dependency</td>
        <td>✅</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>external system</td>
        <td>✅</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>intermediate layer</td>
        <td>❌</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <notes>
      If we mock direct dependencies and the test fails, thats a good thing because it means the contracts of our
      dependencies has changed.

      If the mocked layer is at the external system level, its another good failure that can start a conversation about
      how an API's contract has changed from underneath us.

      If we mock at some intermediate depth, its another form of useless pain that gives us no valuable feedback

    improper use of mocks undercut the ROI of your tests

    <notes>
      The common thread between these last three examples is: improper use of mocks undercut the ROI of your tests.

      We can't defend the value of our tests if they fail for reasons that don't mean anything and must change in ways
      we can't anticipate.

  <div>
    😕 testing with mock data instead of real data
    <notes>
      Rational but dubious uses of mocks.

      We should mock dependencies, but pass real values to our test subjects. Real values contain useful type
      information and should be cheap and easy to create with no side effects. If they aren't, make them better.
    </notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    😕 using mocks to shut up side effects
    <notes>
      Good module design is free of side effects and idempotent. If you are using mocks to silence side effects of
      requiring modules in tests, fix your modules and remove the side effects.

  <div>
    😕 neglecting tests' design feedback
    <notes>
      If a test inflicts pain, people tend to blame the test -- even when the root cause is in the code's design.
      Hard to test code is hard to use code.

    👌 discovery testing
    <notes>
      Others call this test driving design or outside-in test driven design.

      Use tests to write the code we wish we had.

      This enables and lowers the bar for:
      - Reliable incremental progress
      - single-responsibility units
      - intention-revealing names
      - discoverable organization
      - separate values and logic
      - mostly sync pure functions
