<Notes>
  <p>
    Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle
    features from function components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React lifecycle features
    without classes. (We don’t recommend rewriting your existing components
    overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new ones if you’d like.)
  </p>
  <p>
    React provides a few built-in Hooks and you can also create your own Hooks
    to reuse stateful behavior between different components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting with 16.8.0, React includes a stable implementation of React Hooks
    for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>React DOM</li>
    <li>React DOM Server</li>
    <li>React Test Renderer</li>
    <li>React Shallow Renderer</li>
  </ul>
  <em>
    Note that to enable Hooks, all React packages need to be 16.8.0 or higher.
    Hooks won’t work if you forget to update, for example, React DOM.
  </em>
</Notes>

## What problems does Hooks solve?

---

### It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components

<Notes>
  <p>
    React doesn’t offer a way to “attach” reusable behavior to a component (for
    example, connecting it to a store).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’ve worked with React for a while, you may be familiar with patterns
    like render props and higher-order components that try to solve this. But
    these patterns require you to restructure your components when you use them,
    which can be cumbersome and make code harder to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you look at a typical React application in React DevTools, you will
    likely find a “wrapper hell” of components surrounded by layers of
    providers, consumers, higher-order components, render props, and other
    abstractions. While we could filter them out in DevTools, this points to a
    deeper underlying problem: React needs a better primitive for sharing
    stateful logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be
    tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic
    without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks
    among many components or with the community.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

### Complex components become hard to understand

<Notes>
  <p>
    We’ve often had to maintain components that started out simple but grew into
    an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects. Each lifecycle
    method often contains a mix of unrelated logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, components might perform some data fetching in
    componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, the same
    componentDidMount method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets
    up event listeners, with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but completely
    unrelated code ends up combined in a single method. This makes it too easy
    to introduce bugs and inconsistencies. In many cases it’s not possible to
    break these components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all
    over the place. It’s also difficult to test them.
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions
    based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or
    fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.
  </p>
</Notes>

### Classes confuse both people and machines

<Appear>
  <strong>There are no plans to remove classes from React</strong>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  <p>
    In addition to making code reuse and code organization more difficult, we’ve
    found that classes can be a large barrier to learning React.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have to understand how this works in JavaScript, which is very different
    from how it works in most languages. You have to remember to bind the event
    handlers. Without unstable syntax proposals, the code is very verbose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classes present issues for today’s tools, too. For example, classes don’t
    minify very well, and they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The React team wants to present an API that makes it more likely for code to
    stay on the optimizable path. To solve these problems, Hooks let you use
    more of React’s features without classes. Conceptually, React components
    have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without
    sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to
    imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional
    or reactive programming techniques.
  </p>

<Notes>
  <p>
    useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.
  </p>
  <strong>What does calling useState do?</strong>
  <p>
    It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could
    call it anything else, like `banana`.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls —
    useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that `this.state`
    provides in a class.
  </p>
  <strong>What do we pass to useState as an argument?</strong>
  <p>The only argument to the `useState()` Hook is the initial state.</p>
  <p>
    Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object. We can keep a
    number or a string if that’s all we need. In our example, we just want a
    number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for
    our variable. (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would
    call useState() twice.)
  </p>
  <p>
    State variables can hold objects and arrays just fine, so you can still
    group related data together.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, unlike <code>this.setState</code> in a class, updating a state
    variable always replaces it instead of merging it.
  </p>
  <strong>What does useState return?</strong>
  <p>
    It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates
    it. This is why we write <code>const [count, setCount] = useState()</code>.
    This is similar to <code>this.state.count</code> and{' '}
    <code>this.setState</code> in a class, except you get them in a pair. If we
    want to update the current `count`, we can call `setCount`.
  </p>
  <p>We will look more indepth at the useState hook later on.</p>

  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/SideEffectClassExample')}
  steps={[
    {},
    {range:[9,15]}
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>In React class components, the render method itself shouldn’t cause side effects. It would be too early — we typically want to perform our effects after React has updated the DOM.</p>
<p>This is why in React classes, we put side effects into componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. Coming back to our example, here is a React counter class component that updates the document title right after React makes changes to the DOM</p>
<strong>Note how we have to duplicate the code between these two lifecycle methods in class.</strong>
<p>This is because in many cases we want to perform the same side effect regardless of whether the component just mounted, or if it has been updated. Conceptually, we want it to happen after every render — but React class components don’t have a method like this. We could extract a separate method but we would still have to call it in two places.</p>
</Notes>

  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components</p>
  <p>
    Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in
    React components are all examples of side effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate,
    and componentWillUnmount combined.
  </p>
  <p>We will take a more indepth look at the useEffect hook later on.</p>

## Rules of Hooks

---

### Only call Hooks at the top level

<Appear>
  <Anchor href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation" target="blank">Explanation</Anchor>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  <p>
    React relies on the order in which Hooks are called so its important to
    ensure the order of the Hook calls is the same on every render.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead,
    always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.
  </p>
  <p>
    By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order
    each time a component renders. That’s what allows React to correctly
    preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a nice explanation of how this works and why it is important in the React Hooks documentation.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

### Only call hooks from React functions

</Appear>

<Notes>
  <p>Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Call Hooks from React function components.</li>
    <li>Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we’ll learn about them shortly).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is
    clearly visible from its source code.
  </p>

## Building Your Own Hooks

<Notes>
  <p>Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions</p>
</Notes>

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/FriendStatus')}
  steps={[{}, { range: [2, 13] }]}
/>

<Notes>
<p>Here we have a function component from a chat application that displays a message indicitaing whether a friend is online or offline.</p>
<p>(highlight code) We can see the use of both the useState hook and useEffect hooks to keep track of whether the friend is online and subscribe to updates from the chat API respectively.</p>

</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/FriendListItem')}
  steps={[{}, { range: [2, 13] }]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Now let’s say that our chat application also has a contact list, and we want
    to render names of online users with a green color.
  </p>
  <p>
    (highlight code) We could copy and paste similar logic above into our
    FriendListItem component but it wouldn’t be ideal
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, we’d like to share this logic between FriendStatus and
    FriendListItem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Traditionally in React, we’ve had two popular ways to share stateful logic
    between components: render props and higher-order components. We will now
    look at how Hooks solve many of the same problems without forcing you to add
    more components to the tree.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title={() => <Heading3>Extract logic into custom hook</Heading3>}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/useFriendStatus')}
  steps={[{}, { range: [4, 15] }]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    When we want to share logic between two JavaScript functions, we extract it
    to a third function. Both components and Hooks are functions, so this works
    for them too!
  </p>
  <p>
    A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that
    may call other Hooks.
  </p>
  <p>
    (hightlight code) There’s nothing new inside of it — the logic is copied
    from the components above. Just like in a component, make sure to only call
    other Hooks unconditionally at the top level of your custom Hook.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike a React component, a custom Hook doesn’t need to have a specific
    signature. We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything,
    it should return. Its name should always start with use so that you can tell
    at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of our useFriendStatus Hook is to subscribe us to a friend’s
    status. This is why it takes friendID as an argument, and returns whether
    this friend is online.
  </p>
</Notes>

<CodeSurferSplit
  title={() => <Heading3>Replace duplicate code with custom hook</Heading3>}

  <CodeSurfer
    code={require('!raw-loader!./src/FriendStatusWithHook')}
    steps={[{}, { lines: [2] }]}
  />
  <CodeSurfer
    code={require('!raw-loader!./src/FriendListItemWithHook')}
    steps={[{}, { lines: [2] }]}
  />
</CodeSurferSplit>

<Notes>
  <strong>Is this code equivalent to the original examples?</strong>
  <p>
    Yes, it works in exactly the same way. You’ll notice we didn’t make any
    changes to the behavior. All we did was to extract some common code between
    two functions into a separate function. Custom Hooks are a convention that
    naturally follows from the design of Hooks, rather than a React feature.
  </p>
  <strong>Do I have to name my custom Hooks starting with “use”?</strong>
  <p>
    Please do. This convention is very important. Without it, we wouldn’t be
    able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we
    couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it.
  </p>
  <strong>Do two components using the same Hook share state?</strong>
  <p>
    No. Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up
    a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a
    custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.
  </p>
  <strong>How does a custom Hook get isolated state?</strong>
  <p>
    Each call to a Hook gets isolated state. Because we call useFriendStatus
    directly, from React’s point of view our component just calls useState and
    useEffect. And as we learned earlier, we can call useState and useEffect
    many times in one component, and they will be completely independent.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title={() => <Heading3>Passing data Between Hooks</Heading3>}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/ChatRecipientPicker')}
  steps={[{}, { lines: [8, 9, 13, 16] }]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Since Hooks are functions, we can pass information between them. To
    illustrate this, we’ll use another component from our hypothetical chat
    example. This is a chat message recipient picker that displays whether the
    currently selected friend is online:
  </p>
  <p>
    We keep the currently chosen friend ID in the recipientID state variable,
    and update it if the user chooses a different friend in the &lt;select&gt;
    picker. Because the useState Hook call gives us the latest value of the
    recipientID state variable, we can pass it to our custom useFriendStatus
    Hook as an argument.
  </p>
  <p>
    This lets us know whether the currently selected friend is online. If we
    pick a different friend and update the recipientID state variable, our
    useFriendStatus Hook will unsubscribe from the previously selected friend,
    and subscribe to the status of the newly selected one.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Basic Hooks

---

`useState`

<CodeSurferCustom code="const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);" />

Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

<Notes>
  <p>Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.</p>
  <p>
    During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the
    value passed as the first argument (initialState).
  </p>
  <p>
    The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state
    value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
  </p>
  <p>
    During subsequent re-renders, the first value returned by useState will
    always be the most recent state after applying updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a
    function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and
    return an updated value.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    <p>
      Unlike the setState method found in class components, useState does not
      automatically merge update objects. You can replicate this behavior by
      combining the function updater form with object spread syntax or
      Object.assign
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option is useReducer, which is more suited for managing state
      objects that contain multiple sub-values.
    </p>
  </p>
  <strong>Lazy initial state</strong>
  <p>
    The initialState argument is the state used during the initial render. In
    subsequent renders, it is disregarded. If the initial state is the result of
    an expensive computation, you may provide a function instead, which will be
    executed only on the initial render:
  </p>
  <strong>Bailing out of a state update</strong>
  <p>
    If you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state, React
    will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects
  </p>
</Notes>

---

`useEffect`

<CodeSurferCustom code="useEffect(didUpdate);" />

Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.

<Notes>
  <p>Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.</p>
  <p>
    Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not
    allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s
    render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in
    the UI.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, use <code>useEffect</code>. The function passed to useEffect will
    run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an
    escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to
    fire it only when certain values have changed.
  </p>
  <strong>Cleaning up an effect</strong>
  <p>
    Often, effects create resources that need to be cleaned up before the
    component leaves the screen, such as a subscription or timer ID. To do this,
    the function passed to useEffect may return a clean-up function
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Timing of effects</strong>
    <p>
      Unlike componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, the function passed to
      useEffect fires after layout and paint, during a deferred event.
    </p>
    <p>
      For effects that cannot be deferred, for example a DOM mutation that is
      visible to the user, React provides one additional Hook called
      useLayoutEffect. It has the same signature as useEffect, and only differs
      in when it is fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although useEffect is deferred until after the browser has painted, it’s
      guaranteed to fire before any new renders. React will always flush a
      previous render’s effects before starting a new update.
    </p>
  </p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title={() => <Heading2>Cleaning up an effect</Heading2>}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/CleaningUpAnEffect')}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    The clean-up function runs before the component is removed from the UI to
    prevent memory leaks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, if a component renders multiple times (as they typically do),
    the previous effect is cleaned up before executing the next effect.</p>
  <p>
    In our example, this means a new subscription is created on every update.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title={() => <Heading2>Conditionally Firing An Effect</Heading2>}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./src/ConditionallyFiringAnEffect')}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>
    The default behavior for effects is to fire the effect after every completed
    render. That way an effect is always recreated if one of its inputs changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this may be overkill in some cases, like the subscription example
    from the previous section. We don’t need to create a new subscription on
    every update, only if the source props has changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    To implement this, pass a second argument to useEffect that is the array of
    values that the effect depends on. Our updated example now looks like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    Passing in an empty array [] of inputs tells React that your effect doesn’t
    depend on any values from the component, so that effect would run only on
    mount and clean up on unmount; it won’t run on updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>
    <p>
      The array of inputs is not passed as arguments to the effect function.
      Conceptually, though, that’s what they represent: every value referenced
      inside the effect function should also appear in the inputs array. In the
      future, a sufficiently advanced compiler could create this array
      automatically.
    </p>
  </p>
</Notes>

---

`useContext`

<CodeSurferCustom code="const context = useContext(Context);" />

Accepts a context object (the value returned from `React.createContext`) and returns the current context value, as given by the nearest context provider for the given context.

<Notes>
  <p>
    When the provider updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the latest
    context value.
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Additional Hooks

<Notes>
  The following Hooks are either variants of the basic ones from the previous
  section, or only needed for specific edge cases. Don’t stress about learning
  them up front.
</Notes>

---

`useReducer`

<CodeSurferCustom code="const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);" />

Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)

---

`useCallback`

<CodeSurferCustom
  code={`
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  },
  [a, b],
);
`}
/>

Returns a memoized callback.

---

`useMemo`

<CodeSurferCustom code="const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);" />

Returns a memoized value.

---

`useRef`

<CodeSurferCustom code="const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);" />

Returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`initialValue`).
The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

---

`useImperativeHandle`

<CodeSurferCustom code="useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, [inputs])" />

Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`.

---

`useLayoutEffect`

<CodeSurferCustom code="useLayoutEffect(didUpdate);" />

The signature is identical to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

---

`useDebugValue`

<CodeSurferCustom code="useDebugValue(value)" />

Can be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.
